# FEFTwiddler
A save editor for Fire Emblem Fates

What this does:
* Opens a "chapter" save
* Shows a few things
* Lets you apply some cheats or make some changes
* Lets you save changes to the file you opened

How to use:
* Backup your save. You'll need homebrew and svdt or some other save manager. Also if you're on the digital version, you need CFW I think because of newer save encryption.
* Copy your save to your computer.
* MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVE IN CASE ANYTHING GOES WRONG.
* (Optionally) Decompress it using FEST, available here: https://github.com/RainThunder/FEST
* File > Open
* Click cheat buttons
* File > Save
* Restore the save

Have fun, and I guess report problems? I don't know how much I'll add to this...

Special thanks:
* RainThunder for making FEST https://github.com/RainThunder/FEST
* SciresM for making FEAST, which FEST is based upon https://github.com/SciresM/FEAST
* Also RainThunder for making the convoy editor, which I drew some inspiration from https://github.com/RainThunder/Fire-Emblem-Fates-Convoy-Editor
* Various posters (KuroKairaku, TheGrandGander, probably others) in the threads about this game on Serenesforest.net and Gbatemp.net for a few hex offsets that were tricky to find on my own
* Other Serenesforest posters (EldinTokuro, 9Hopper) for reporting bugs and giving me their saves to test with
* RainThunder and rilne for contributing bug fixes
* Whoever ripped the skill icon graphics and whoever put them onto the Serenesforest.net website. Thanks for using the IDs in the file names, by the way. That made my life a little easier!
* Whoever compiled these ID lists: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bem9eu9IAEBm7d6PBZhtddDnDUnLpdoZ7ddenFSURmw/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=1077677946 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAdsxVVxNKaxu90Lnb4WfWM-HH2TFLfNFQzsYwIDmKs/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=0
* I think that's it? I hope I didn't forget anyone!

Also, shoutout to ShadowMario3 for the complete support log save file that he posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/49omnd/100_support_log_global_save_file_for_fates/

That kind of inspired me to do this at all, and I'll probably add code to do that to this later on.
